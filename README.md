# libsodium-talk

## Abstract
Cryptography has never been an approachable subject, especially when it comes to computing. Libsodium has set out to change that.
We hear about systems being compromised on a daily basis with millions of passwords out on the web free to use
to access other site's accounts and systems. This is unacceptable! What happens when these systems are compromised?
Can crackers access your "encrypted" data? Can they access your "hashed" passwords? This talk will discuss proper
hashing mechanisms for passwords, libsodium, and encryption and how it relates to our PHP applications and systems.

## Outline
